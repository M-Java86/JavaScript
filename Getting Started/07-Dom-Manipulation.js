//Dom-Manipulation
//The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. 
//It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

//The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. 
//That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
//A Web page is a document. This document can either be displayed in the browser window 
//or as the HTML source, but it is the same document in both cases. The DOM represents that same document so it can be manipulated / modified with a scripting language, such as JavaScript.
