//ASI- is Automatic Semi-Colon insertion and can be a fiddly aspect of JavaScript

//Declare a few variables / code blocks and terminate the code appropriately.

//1.Remove the semi-colons from the variables / 
//code-blocks that you've written and see if there is an affect on the output.

//2.Have a look at the below code and try to spot where there might be an error:

function sayHello() {
    return; // A semi-colon after return and this will alter the value of the function
    {
      "Someone says hello";
    }
  }
